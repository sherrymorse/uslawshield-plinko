This updated code addresses your concerns with the following changes:

1. **Added Ramp for Momentum Build-Up**:
   - Increased the canvas height from 800px to 900px to add a 100px ramp at the top of the board.
   - The ramp is visually represented as a gray trapezoid (`#4a4a4a`) at the top, angled at 30 degrees downward (`RAMP_SLOPE = -Math.PI / 6`).
   - When the disc is dropped within the ramp zone (`y < RAMP_HEIGHT`), it experiences acceleration based on the ramp’s slope (vertical and horizontal components of gravity), allowing it to build momentum before hitting the pegs.
   - Extended the drop zone (`DROP_ZONE_Y_MAX`) to 150px to include the ramp, so users can drop the disc anywhere in this area.
   - Applied a moderate friction coefficient (`RAMP_FRICTION = 0.95`) on the ramp to simulate a smooth surface, slightly slowing the disc but allowing momentum to build.

2. **Friction-Heavy Board**:
   - Implemented a high friction coefficient (`BOARD_FRICTION = 0.93`) for the main board (below the ramp), reducing velocity more significantly to mimic a friction-heavy surface, as seen in the Price is Right Plinko game where the board slightly resists the disc’s motion.

3. **Maintained Bouncy and Random Peg Interactions**:
   - Kept the high elasticity for peg collisions (0.99) to ensure very bouncy reactions, mimicking the sharp rebounds in the Price is Right game.
   - Maintained the random perturbation (1.5) for peg collisions to ensure highly unpredictable, zig-zagging paths.
   - Ensured a minimum vertical velocity (0.5) to prevent the disc from stalling.

4. **Prevented Wall Sticking**:
   - Kept the position offset (`+2` pixels) for wall collisions, with high elasticity (0.98) and randomness (0.8) to prevent sticking and ensure energetic bounces off the side walls.

5. **Lightweight Gravity**:
   - Maintained gravity at 0.12 for both the ramp and board phases, ensuring the disc remains lightweight and bounces multiple times (typically 5-10 seconds to reach the bottom, as in the real game).

6. **Streamlined Disc Retrieval System**:
   - Continued showing only available discs in the sidebar, labeled as “Disc #N” with an SVG icon for clarity.
   - Kept visual feedback: discs scale up (1.1x) and fade when dragged, indicating possession.
   - Maintained the instruction: “Drag a disc to the top of the board and release to drop!” and the “Earn More Discs” button for intuitive navigation.

7. **Robust Drag-and-Drop**:
   - Ensured the drag-and-drop system is reliable by validating `draggingIndex` and preventing interaction when a disc is in motion.
   - Discs can be dropped anywhere within the top 150px of the canvas, including the ramp, and within board bounds.

**Physics Explanation (Price is Right Plinko Behavior)**:
- In the Price is Right Plinko game, discs are dropped from a ramp or slot at the top, gaining initial momentum before hitting a field of pegs. The board is slightly frictional (often felt-covered), slowing the disc’s motion, while pegs are rigid, causing sharp, random bounces. The disc’s lightweight nature (~50-100g) and low gravity result in a 5-10 second descent with frequent, unpredictable zig-zags.
- The updated code replicates this by:
  - Adding a 100px ramp with a 30-degree slope, applying slope-based acceleration to build momentum.
  - Using a friction-heavy board (`BOARD_FRICTION = 0.93`) to slow the disc’s motion, mimicking the felt-like surface.
  - Maintaining high peg elasticity (0.99) and strong randomness (1.5) for lively, unpredictable bounces.
  - Keeping low gravity (0.12) for a slow, bouncy descent.
  - Implementing position corrections and minimum velocity to prevent sticking.

To apply these changes:
1. Replace the contents of `index.html` in your repository[](https://github.com/sherrymorse/uslawshield-plinko/edit/main/index.html).
2. Commit and push to update the live site[](https://sherrymorse.github.io/uslawshield-plinko/).

The disc should now gain momentum on the ramp, experience a friction-heavy board, and exhibit very random, bouncy peg interactions, closely matching the Price is Right Plinko experience. If the ramp behavior or physics still feel off (e.g., insufficient momentum or incorrect bounce), please describe the specific issue, and I can fine-tune the parameters further.
